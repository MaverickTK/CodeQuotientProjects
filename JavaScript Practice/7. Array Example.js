// Store data in Arrays

// example : check for the list of people invited in Party
var people = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"];

// to check whether a element is present in the array or not : use include method
var checkingName = prompt("Whats your name ?");
people.includes(checkingName); // this will return boolean value
